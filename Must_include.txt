🟡 Phase 2: Data & Design

Goal: Learn to organize code and think in structures.

Project 3: Contact Management System

Must include

Add/search/edit/delete contacts

Save/load from file

Clean menu system

Upgrade challenge

Use classes

Import/export CSV


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great choice. I’ll give you **guiding steps only** — no code, no solutions — so *you* do the thinking.
Treat this like a real software task.

# Project 3: Contact Management System

**Goal:** Design and build it yourself.

---

## 1️⃣ Define the Core Requirements

Before coding, answer *on paper or in comments*:

* What is a **contact**?

  * What fields does it have? (name, phone, email, etc.)
* What actions must the user be able to do?

  * Add?
  * View?
  * Search?
  * Edit?
  * Delete?

⚠️ Rule: If you can’t describe it clearly, don’t code yet.

---

## 2️⃣ Decide How Data Will Be Stored (In Memory)

Think about:

* One contact vs many contacts
* Fast searching
* Easy editing

Questions to ask yourself:

* Should contacts be in a list or dictionary?
* What uniquely identifies a contact?
* How will you avoid duplicates?

Write your **data structure choice** down.

---

## 3️⃣ Sketch the User Interface (CLI)

Design the menu *before* writing code.

Example thinking (not an answer):

* How does the user see options?
* How do they select actions?
* How does the program loop back to the menu?

Make sure:

* The program doesn’t crash on bad input
* The user can exit cleanly

---

## 4️⃣ Break Features into Functions

For each action:

* What should the function receive?
* What should it return?
* What should it NOT do?

Think about:

* Single responsibility
* Reusable logic

Write function *names only* first.

---

## 5️⃣ Implement Basic Features One by One

Order matters. Choose wisely.

Suggested thinking order:

1. Show menu
2. Add a contact
3. View all contacts
4. Search contacts
5. Edit contact
6. Delete contact

After each step:

* Run the program
* Try to break it intentionally

---

## 6️⃣ Add Input Validation & Error Handling

Ask yourself:

* What if the user presses Enter?
* What if they type letters instead of numbers?
* What if they search for something that doesn’t exist?

Your program should:

* Never crash
* Always explain what went wrong

---

## 7️⃣ Add File Persistence

Now think beyond memory.

Questions:

* When does data get saved?
* What happens when the program starts?
* What format should the file be in?

Do not redesign everything — **adapt your existing structure**.

---

## 8️⃣ Refactor the Code

Look at your program and ask:

* Are functions too long?
* Is logic duplicated?
* Are names clear?

You should:

* Move repeated logic into functions
* Rename confusing variables
* Simplify conditionals

---

## 9️⃣ Upgrade: Introduce Classes

Only after everything works.

Think:

* What represents a contact?
* What represents the contact book?
* Which functions belong to which class?

Avoid rewriting everything at once.

---

## 🔁 Self-Test Checklist (Very Important)

You’re done only if:

* You can explain every line of code
* You can add a new feature easily
* You can rewrite it from scratch
* You can fix bugs without panic

---

## 🧠 Final Rule

If you feel uncomfortable or stuck:

> **That’s exactly where learning is happening.**

If you want, next I can:

* Ask you **design questions** one by one
* Review your project *conceptually* (no code)
* Give you **upgrade challenges** when you finish

Just tell me where you’re stuck 👌
